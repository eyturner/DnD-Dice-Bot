What smells worse than a goblin? Oh yeah, you!
Your mother takes up more tiles than a gelatinous cube!
You're the reason baby gnomes cry!
I've seen more threatening geckos!
On a scale of 1 - 10, you're proper screwed!
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberry!
Well, my time of not taking you seriously is coming to a middle!
A wet cat is tougher than you!
It's a real shame that your last words will be so vapid.
Well...I have met sharper loaves of bread!
Did someone teach you wrong as a joke?
When wizards cast detect thoughts on you do they wonder why it didn't work?
Your magic is as bad as your breath!
Why don't you give me your weapon so I can hit myself with it, because that'd be more effective than you trying it!
You call that an attack, I've seen dead kittens hit harder than that!
Very impressive, I think I'll hire you out for children's parties!
One day I'm going to make a ballad of this fight. Tell me your name, I hope it rhymes with horribly slaughtered!
Wait, wait, I just need to ask, what do you need us to put on your headstone!
You do know the pointy end is suppose to go in the other guy, right!
Someone done blowed out your kindling.
You are impossible to underestimate.
You fight like a dairy farmer!
Wow! You did way better than I thought you would do. That’s great!
If I agreed with you, we’d both be wrong.
