What smells worse than a goblin? Oh yeah, you!
Your mother takes up more tiles than a gelatinous cube!
You're the reason baby gnomes cry!
I've seen more threatening geckos!
On a scale of 1 - 10, you're proper screwed!
Your mother was a kobold and your father smelled of elderberry!
Well, my time of not taking you seriously is coming to a middle!
A wet cat is tougher than you!
It's a real shame that your last words will be so vapid.
Well...I have met sharper loaves of bread!
Did someone teach you wrong as a joke?
When wizards cast detect thoughts on you do they wonder why it didn't work?
