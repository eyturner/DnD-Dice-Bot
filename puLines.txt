I hope your AC is low cuz I just gotta hit that.
Are you a mind flayer? Because my brain has been totally consumed by you.
Are you a Rogue? Because you stole my heart.
Are you a gelatinous cube? Because you melted my heart.
You're so fine, I'm taking -2 to attack rolls.
Are you a wizard? 'Cuz you cast a spell on me
Are you a bard? 'Cuz you're plucking at my heartstrings.
I hope you're a druid, 'cuz this animal wants to be...handled.
Want a +3 Rod of Pleasure?
I put on my robe and wizard hat...
